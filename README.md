### 🧠 Core Algorithms and Data Structures

This folder contains implementations of foundational computer science concepts, demonstrating logical thinking and efficiency in Python.

**Focus:** Mastering essential data structures and traversal algorithms necessary for understanding complex software systems (like ERPs).

| File Name | Description | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `binary_search_tree.py` | Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) including iterative/recursive search, insertion, and validation. | **Pointers, Recursion, O(h) efficiency.** |
| `graph_algorithms.py` | Implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for graph traversal using an Adjacency Matrix. | **Queues (deque), Stack/Recursion, Graph Logic.** |
